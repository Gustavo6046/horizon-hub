# Warning System

To minimize the risk of personal bias and unfair actions, a warning system is in
place. Every time a large infraction of the rules, or spree of smaller infractions,
is committed, the user's Warning Level will rise by 1. The Warning Level is kept
track of by using a role system. If this Warning Level reaches 3, the next
infraction instead results in a mute, and the person is
[queued for trial](trial.md).

In court, their case is discussed individually, with results ranging from a pardon
(with punishment lifted and warning levels nullified or reduced), to, in more severe
cases, a permanent ban.

A list of users who have once been banned is kept by the staff; anyone who returns
after a ban expiraland commits another infraction will be permanently banned,
because justice is concerned with individuals, not user accounts. Thus, evading a ban
generally results in a permanent ban, unless the ban in question has been expired.
