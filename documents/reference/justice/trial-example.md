## Pretext

_JoeBad_ is accused of member harassment and general bot abuse. The three warning levels were fully exhausted, and he has been assigned the Defendant role, which is an in-server probation, with very restricted access.

## Initial Testification

A member of the Administration, or one of the Chief Moderators, sees that the court is not in use, and initiates the case. *JoeBad*'s case is handled this time, with him being chosen as the defendant. _JoeBad_ may, for clarity's sake, be referred to as the **Defendant**.

First, one of the purported victims, _Alli_, is inducted as a Testifier. That is, the role Testifier is set, so they may speak in #court. _Alli_ may, for clarity's sake, be referred to as **Testifier #1**. _Alli_ was mentioned by _JoeBad_ in one of his rantages, as an unknown clash had happened between the two previously.

**Handler:** Thanks \[Alli\], Is it true that Joe was being unpleasant to you in some way? Can you tell us more about it?
**Testifier #1:** Yeah, he was being an idiot to me, I'm not sure if that has anything to do with what happened earlier, but yeah, feel free to ask about it.
**Handler:** Alright, then. \[Alli,\] please submit your testification with regards to \[JoeBad\]'s acts of harassment and bot abuse.
**Testifier #1:** He was making some really dumb jokes in dm's, even after I told him to stop. I blocked him, but then he started annoying other people in the Hub about it. That's all I know.
**Handler:** Excellent, thank you.

After helping the handler team, _Alli_'s Testifier role is unset, and the case continues. For now, the handling administration/moderation writes their thoughts on the provided testification.

**Handler:** I think that it sounds reasonable. It corroborates with the message logs, so I think no further testification is needed for the moment.

## Defendant's Argument

Since no further testification is currently requested, the handler gives the **Defendant**, that is _JoeBad_,, the Testifier role. This does not state that they are a witness, but rather allows them to speak in #court.

**Handler:** You saw what (s)he wrote. Do you have any argument against it? If you have nothing to say, do you plea guilty or not guilty?

Joe responds within 5 (five) minutes, which is well within the maximum of 40 (forty).

**Defendant:** She was dissing my homie _Lyon_ the other day, I had to do that vibe check on DM's. But she was being all fancy-schmanzy and stubborn to tell about it, so I decided to flip out about her.
**Handler:** Alright, so no plea?
**Defendant:** I plea not guilty.
**Handler:** You presented an argument, or something, so I will see about that.

## Case Development

As the defendant did present a counter-argument, it is possible to request further testification, and the plea is considered inconclusive, that is, not enough to form a resolute decision such as a sentence. _JoeBad_'s Testifier role is, of course, unset.

In this hypothetical example case, it turns out that _Lyon_ is also a known Hub member. They are inducted to testify as well. For the sake of clarity, log headers will refer to him as **Testifier #2**.

**Handler:** So, \[Lyon,\] we are trialing \[JoeBad\] over general harassment and bot abuse. You can read above. Allegedly, the defendant was harassing \[Alli\] in private messages, which she blocked, which caused him to continue his provocations in the Hub. However, \[JoeBad's\] allegations contradict with that, and state that she had pestered you in some way prior to, and according to him justifying, his actions. Can you tell us about it? Do you have anything to say about it?
**Testifier #2:** Oh, Joe is lying. I and Alli were roleplaying in the channels, just for fun, and I guess that upset Joe. I dunno why, it wasn't anything serious.
**Handler:** Ah, I see. Thank you.

_Lyon_'s Testifier role is unset.

It is now apparent to the Handler that Joe was lying about it, and that it was, in fact, a casual roleplay between Alli and Lyon, which is a blow to Joe's own credibility in the case. However, it still pends confirmation, so once again Alli is inducted to testify.

**Handler:** Sorry that I have to inquire you again \[@_Alli_\], but Lyon has alleged that you two were performing casual roleplay in the Hub channels, and that that might have upset Joe.
**Testifier #1:** Yeah, Joe was mad about it, but he seemed passive-aggressive more than anything. At first, anyway.
**Handler:** Thank you.

After this brief exchange, Alli is once again exducted, that is, her Testifier role unset.

## Conclusion

With all the corroboration from the testifiers, and the defendant's contradiction, it is clear that there is no gray area to argue about. The Defendant is inducted once more.

**Handler:** Anything to say in your defense?
**Defendant:** No.
**Handler:** Alright. Do you plea guilty or not guilty?
**Defendant::** Guilty.
**Handler:** Thanks.

Having resignated to the accusations, _JoeBad_ finally admits to his wrongdoings. 

**Handler:** I deem you guilty of harassment, and sentence you to a 48 hour mute, server-wide. Please don't do this kind of stuff, it's not just against the rules, it's unnecessary and it won't make anything better. Next time you feel upset about something like this, just talk about it in #general-ranting or #drama-counseling.
**Defendant:** Fine.
**Handler:** No, we will not fine you.
**Defendant:** No, I mean as in, alright.
**Handler:** Ah. Alright. I guess this concludes the trials, then.

Once the mute is applied, the court is freed.
