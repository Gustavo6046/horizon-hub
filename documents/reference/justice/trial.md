# Court Procedure

When, and how, a #court case should be handled by the @Hub Administration  and @Hub Chief Moderators.

------

If a member ever exceeds the three levels of the [warning system](warning.md), or commits an infraction severe enough to bypass the warning system altogether, they are eligible for a court trial. In this case, the Administration and/or Moderation shall refer to this document for handling witness testification and defendant prosecution. [See here for an example](trial-example.md).

​
- 1. "[IN USE]" is prepended to the start of the channel topic or description, since only one trial can occur at a time. Then, for each party involved in the events discussed, a round of testification occurs, where they provide relevant information.

In a round of testification, the Administration and/or the Moderation will "induct" a relevant member to the Court, by means of assigning to them the Testifier role. They will be pinged in the #court channel, and a request for information will be made. Once the information is provided, the tesitfication may be concluded; the Testifier role is unset, and, if there are any other members to testify, this procedure may be repeated for them. The round ends when it is determined by the Administration and/or the Moderation that no further testification is necessary for the continuation of the trial.
Note: Only one testification can occur at once.

 Once all parties present their information, the defendant is allowed to either:
​  • argue against any incriminating information, which is followed by another round of testification;
​  • plea guilty, which ends the testification; or
​  • if no information is testified, or that which is testified can be deemed non-incriminating, plea not guilty.

In either case, the Administration may inquire for further testification from other relevant parties. Coercing any Hub Member to testify or to provide more information than they are willing to during testification is unconstitutional.

If and only if the defendant has been given the chance to argue or plea at least once, and actually carried out either of the two actions, the Administration may at any point decide that enough testification and discussion has been made, and continue to step 2. Remember that this doesn't always apply if a defendant hasn't argued, only if they have been given the options to argue or plea, but pleaded or carried out with neither choice.

​
- 2. Weighing the facts, the testification, and the severity of the situation, the Administration now determines which infractions precisely have been committed by the defendant, or if any has been committed at all. If they are determined to be guilty, they also choose a resolution to the case, without necessarily determining the defendant as guilty or not guilty. The resolution can be either:
​  • a pardon, which lifts all previous punishment hitherto, which includes the assignment of the Defendant role and all warning levels;
​  • a temporary ban, or
​  • a permanent ban,
in that order of gravity. 

If a defendant is determined to be not guilty, all the warning levels are unset, as well as the Defendant role, and any preemptive punishment (if any) is reverted. No further punishment can be issued relevant to this court, that is, for as long as no other infraction is made from the same Hub Member.

​
- 3. The court is freed, which means that [IN USE] - and all surrounding whitespace - is cleared from the beginning of the channel topic or description, and any remaining Testifier roles are unset.

If there are still members with the Defendant role set, the Administration and/or the Chief Moderation may from now on trial them as well, once again at a time of their liking or convenience.
